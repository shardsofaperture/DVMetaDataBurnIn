--- 11/30/25

* Added passthrough (convert-only) mode alongside burn-in mode.

* Added missing-metadata behavior options: stop with error, convert without burn-in, or skip file.

* Updated dvmetaburn.zsh to: Parse full dvrescue JSON instead of only the first frame, detect the first valid rdt anywhere in the file and fall back based on --missing-meta= instead of crashing.

* Support --burn-mode=passthrough for no-metadata conversions.

* Added added BurnMode and MissingMetaMode with UI controls for so its now possible to burn-in  text OR convert-only, and changed how missing-metadata behavior is handled (i.e. hopefully won't just crash now)

* Made log selectablew

* Added DVRESCUE debug function (to check to see if metadata is missing or any other issues)

* Added stop and clear log button, as well as made log copyable instead of view only and some other debug stuff

* Fixed MP4 codec from mpeg4 SP to h265 which was the original intent for the conversion.

* Reduced splash screen time to 3 seconds

* Adjusted log behavior to prevent hanging due to wayyyy to many lines spit out by ffmpeg causing a not responding even if comppleted succesfully

* Adjusted log behavior for dvrescue which was also cauing a not responding when debugging due to a large amount of data being pushed though to the log window (xml vomit)
